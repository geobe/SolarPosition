# SolarPosition
Calculate solar position and its resulting impact on photovoltaic cells

## Provide classes to calculate the solar position at a given place on a given time

## Get expected solar irradiation intensity from a weather service site

## Calculate irradiation on photovoltaic cells depending on their geometric position

## Compare calculated with real solar power
