# SolarPosition
Calculate solar position and its resulting impact on photovoltaic cells

### Provide classes to calculate the solar position at a given place on a given time
ToDo Description of classes
### Get expected solar irradiation intensity from a weather service site
Unfortunately not available any more for free from openweathermap.org. Less detailed 
information can be obtained from German weather service (DWD) but is not yet integrated
into this project.

### Calculate irradiation on photovoltaic cells depending on their geometric position
See class TiltProjection

### Compare calculated with real solar power
ToDo. Not implemented yet.

### Run JavaFx Charting Sample
From the root project directory, the sample program can be run
* On Linux: ./gradlew run
* On Windows: gradlew run

JavaFx 11 has to be installed to run sample.
